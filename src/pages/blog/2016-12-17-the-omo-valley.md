A cultural melting pot named after its geographical location and the famous omo river, the south omo zone is a spectacularly beautiful area with diverse attractionâ€™s,ecosystems, cultures & language.

The majority of the region is dry & inhospitable; 0.5% is highland, 5% is Midland, 60% is lowland & 34% is desert. Despite this only 8.5% of the population are Urban dwellers.

The omo valley has at least 16 distinct ethnic groups. Tow of the four main African linguistic families are represented in the area. Nilo-saharian & afro Asiatic, with its branches.

The omo is one of the Ethiopian largest rivers. It flow South for over 700km from the Shewan highlands to the northern end of lake Turkana.some of ethnic groups live alongside the omo river & depend on it for their livelihood.

They have developed complex social-economic & ecological practices reintricately adapted to the harsh and often unpredictable conditions of the region semi-arid climate.

The annual flooding of the omo river guarantees food security for some of the ethnic groups along its bank, especially as rainfall is low and erratic. They depend on it to practice food-retreat cultivation using the rich silt left along the rivers banks by the recoding water.

Having reached its maximum level, the river records rapidly during September & October which is when people start preparing the recently flooded area for flood-retreat cultivation. Some also practice rain-fed shifting cultivation, growing sorghum, maize & tobacco. Some ethnic groups, particularly the Kwegu & Kara, hunt game and fishing.
