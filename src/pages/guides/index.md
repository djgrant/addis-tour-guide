## Abenezer Endale

Originally from Hawassa, in the South of Ethiopia, I grew up in a Rastafarian community. In school I loved learning English because it enabled me to interact with _ferengi_ (a friendly term, meaning foreigners). My journey took me to Addis Ababa to study at the university and I began to work as a tour guide for visitors to Ethiopia. Being a tour guide is my passion as it allows me to share the country I love while meeting and learning from amazing people from around the world!
